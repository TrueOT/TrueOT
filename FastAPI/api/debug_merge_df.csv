However, the asset is isolated within an internal control loop without external exposure, mitigating the network-based attack vector. This isolation reduces the risk from High to Medium."
1,Rockwell ControlLogix,Automotive assembly line motion control,Manufacturing Dept,PLC,Isolated Network,EtherCAT protocol exposed (internal VLAN only),High,Mission Critical,Low,Low,Low,6,Medium,192.168.1.20,CVE-2020- 6998,The connection establishment algorithm found in Rockwell Automation CompactLogix 5370 and ControlLogix 5570,8.6,HIGH,Isolated,"The connection establishment algorithm found in Rockwell Automation CompactLogix 5370 and ControlLogix 5570 versions 33 and prior does not sufficiently manage its control flow during execution, creating an infinite loop. This may allow an attacker to send specially crafted CIP packet requests to a controller, which may cause denial-of-service conditions in communications with other products.",Isolated,Medium,"The vulnerability in Rockwell Automation's CompactLogix and ControlLogix systems, which allows denial-of-service conditions via crafted CIP packets, is network-based. The asset's exposure on an internal VLAN only reduces the risk, as external attackers can't access it. However, the risk isn't entirely mitigated as internal threats still exist. Thus, the risk level is Medium, considering the isolated network and potential internal threats."
2,Schneider Electric HMI,Gas pipeline operator interface and control,Plant Operations,HMI,Control Room,Default credentials (admin/admin â€“ air-gapped network; update advised),Medium,Business Critical,Medium,Medium,High,9,High,192.168.2.30,CVE-2019- 6833,Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability exists in Magelis HMI,6.8,MEDIUM,Anything,"A CWE-754 – Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability exists in Magelis HMI Panels (all versions of - HMIGTO, HMISTO, XBTGH, HMIGTU, HMIGTUX, HMISCU, HMISTU, XBTGT, XBTGT, HMIGXO, HMIGXU), which could cause a temporary freeze of the HMI when a high rate of frames is received. When the attack stops, the buffered commands are processed by the HMI panel.",High,Medium,"The vulnerability in the Magelis HMI Panels, which causes a temporary freeze under high frame rates and subsequent command processing, is network-based. Since the asset is on an air-gapped network, this isolation method effectively mitigates the risk by preventing remote exploitation. However, the asset's high classification and medium safety impact maintain the risk at Medium, as the potential operational disruption, while mitigated, remains significant enough to warrant caution."

Since the asset is on an isolated network, this effectively blocks the attack vector, reducing the risk to Low."
4,Yokogawa CENTUM VP,Nuclear reactor control and safety system,Safety Team,SCADA,Isolated Network,FTP server active (internal data logging; air-gapped),High,Mission Critical,High,High,High,12,Critical,192.168.1.150,CVE-2023- 26593,CENTUM series provided by Yokogawa Electric Corporation are vulnerable to cleartext storage of sensitive information.,7.8,HIGH,Isolated,"CENTUM series provided by Yokogawa Electric Corporation are vulnerable to cleartext storage of sensitive information. If an attacker who can login or access the computer where the affected product is installed tampers the password file stored in the computer, the user privilege which CENTUM managed may be escalated. As a result, the control system may be operated with the escalated user privilege. To exploit this vulnerability, the following prerequisites must be met: (1)An attacker has obtained user credentials where the affected product is installed, (2)CENTUM Authentication Mode is used for user authentication when CENTUM VP is used. The affected products and versions are as follows: CENTUM CS 1000, CENTUM CS 3000 (Including CENTUM CS 3000 Entry Class) R2.01.00 to R3.09.50, CENTUM VP (Including CENTUM VP Entry Class) R4.01.00 to R4.03.00, R5.01.00 to R5.04.20, and R6.01.00 and later, B/M9000 CS R5.04.01 to R5.05.01, and B/M9000 VP R6.01.01 to R7.04.51 and R8.01.01 and later",Isolated,High,"The vulnerability in the CENTUM series involves the cleartext storage of sensitive information, which could allow privilege escalation if an attacker accesses the password file. Although the asset is on an isolated network with an active FTP server for internal logging, this isolation does not mitigate the risk since the vulnerability requires local access. The predefined severity is High, and given the asset's critical classification and high safety impact, the risk remains High as isolation does not protect against local attacks."
